# PetFoxBot
 Buy, raise and have fun with cute foxes with this bot!
 This bot is officially named FoxBot however can be referred to as PetFoxBot or PetFox instead.

# Notice
 This is a WIP standalone bot and is likely not suited for personal use as of now, however it will become easier to use over time.
 This bot is tested for bugs however its impossible for everything to be tested and fixed so please report any issues you find.
 Data loss is very rare but i cant guarantee that everything is safe at this stage. Its your own responsibility to back up any data you really care about. Things will be checked a lot more in the future as usage becomes more common.

# Setup
 Before you can run PetFox locally you need to create a file inside FoxBot called bottoken.txt and then put in a valid bot account token you can use. DO NOT USE A USER TOKEN EVER, IT WILL GET YOU BANNED.
 You also require discord.py to be installed, which you can find the instructions for here: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html
 
 Once you have installed discord.py and entered a valid token, you should run the bot, which will then do a few things and connect. The bot then works in any server as long as it can read and send messages. For usage commands, type -fox, which will handily list out every single command and its usage, alongside some other handy info for you.
 The first thing you should do before trying any of the other commands is -start, which sets up your userdata and then tells you what to do to create a new set of bank data for yourself, which you also need to do, and then you can enjoy the bot as much as you want.

 Note: When running the bot, i recommend opening bot.py in VSCode as it has a handy option that runs the bot even if you dont know what to do, while providing a clean terminal, explorer if you choose to open the folder and of course allows you to freely modify the code which is really good if you want to quickly test features you want to contribute to the bot.
