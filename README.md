# PetFoxBot
 Buy, raise and have fun with cute foxes with this bot!
 This bot is officially named FoxBot however can be referred to as PetFoxBot or PetFox instead.

# Notice
 This is a WIP standalone bot and is likely not suited for personal use as of now, however it will become easier to use personally over time.
 The bot is still very buggy and is known to experience data deletion when erroring, in the future this will be avoided with backups and of course handling data better.

# Setup (WIP)
 Before you can even run PetFox locally you need to create a file inside the downloaded repository called bottoken.txt and then put in a valid bot account token you can use.
 You also require discord.py to be installed, which you can find the instructions for here: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html
 
 Once you have got discord.py and entered a valid token, you should run the bot, which will then start logging any new files it creates, and then it should connect. The bot should then work in any server it has joined into. For using the bot itself, the prefix is - (currently fixed) and the information command is -fox, which will list all the commands for you.
