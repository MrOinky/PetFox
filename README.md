# PetFox
 Buy, raise and have fun with cute foxes with this bot!
 officially named PetFox however can be referred to as PetFoxBot, Discord-PetFox or Discord-PetFox

# Notice
 This is a WIP standalone bot and is likely not suited for personal use as of now, however it will become easier to use personally over time.
 (This is also atm just the repositry setup so note that it doesn't even exist yet, it needs to be entirely converted from my previous cog on RedBot first.)

# Setup (WIP)
 Before you can even run PetFox locally you need to create a file inside the downloaded repository called bottoken.txt and then put in a valid bot account token you can use.
 You also require discord.py to be installed, which you can find the instructions for here: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html
